## What is Danceblocks?

Danceblocks is a web application to help dancers easily plan out blockings for their performance.

## Features

- Dancers are represented as circles with a color and a label on top. They are placed on a stage with center and quarter markings.

- Dancers can be moved to a different position via dragging (applies in real life as well).

- The sidebar on the right shows the information of all dancers on stage. You can add new dancers, edit their label and color, and remove dancers as well.

- 3 dancers are already on stage for you to experiment with these features and play around before starting

## Notes

- Blockings cannot be saved for now, please manually screenshot to save your desired blocking before proceeding to another one. This will be improved in v2.0.0

- Once you reload the website, all changes will be lost and the stage will be reset. This will be improved in v2.0.0
